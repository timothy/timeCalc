## Time Calculator ^_^ 40-hour week count down.
Simple app to show remaining time until a person hits a 40hr week. This was mainly built to help hourly employees know when they hit their max hour limit.
There is still a lot of work to do but the basic functionality is there and accurate.

I am going to add new methods of time calculations soon...
