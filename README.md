# TimeCalc
### Time Calculator that shows the amount of time left until a person hits a 40-hour week.

Simple app to show remaining time until a person hits a 40hr week. This was mainly built to help hourly employees know when they hit their max hour limit.
There is still a lot of work to do but the basic functionality is and accurate.

I am going to add new methods of time calculations soon...
